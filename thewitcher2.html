                        <p>The game features a few timed conversations, with a default response being used if players do not choose an option within a certain length of time. Players are not presented with the full, exact line that Geralt will deliver, instead
                            choosing from among short summaries.
                        </p>
                        <p>The combat system has been reworked, being "much more open-ended" and which "no longer requires the timed input of the original game". The "romance cards" are not returning, although Geralt still has opportunities for encounters.
                            These are now handled with cutscenes. According to a Polish preview, it is possible to import a saved game from The Witcher.</p>
                        <p>Fighting alongside companions has received greater emphasis, although they still act autonomously rather than being under the control of the player. How players relate to these companions (both in conversations and elsewhere) can
                            open up quests and affect the game's ending. Meditation can now be done anywhere, provided there are no enemies nearby to prevent it, but Geralt must now enter meditation mode to drink a potion. Geralt can now climb over walls
                            and other such obstacles.</p>

                        <p>The plot of The Witcher 2 is intended to be less linear than that of the first game, and is supposed to feature "three independent plot lines" which lead to multiple endings.</p>
                        <p>The Witcher 2 is set almost immediately after the first, and follows from the attempt on King Foltest's life which occurred in the final cutscene. Geralt will once again face the mysterious witcher-like assassins, who appear to
                            be connected with a character named in previews as the Kingslayer. In a trailer, the Kingslayer is seen speaking to Iorveth, a human-hating elf. The Kingslayer displays a head which he claims belonged to King Demavend of Aedirn,
                            and says that if Iorveth is prepared to help, more kings will also fall. Other plot elements which have been referenced (but which do not necessarily correspond to the three plot lines mentioned) are Foltest's moves to capture
                            the stronghold of the rebellious Baroness La Valette and "Geralt's personal theme, in which he's looking for his own identity".</p>
                        <p>According to a fact sheet released for the game, Geralt's travels "will lead him up the river Pontar into the turbulent borderland between Temeria, Kaedwen and Aedirn". A town named Flotsam, situated on the border between Temeria
                            and Aedirn, will feature. Characters returning from the first game include Triss Merigold, Zoltan, and Dandelion. A new character to be introduced is Vernon Roche, a member of the Temerian military who has been sent to help
                            Geralt. The narrative takes Geralt from Foltest's side, through an assault on La Valette Castle, then through Flotsam, Aedirn (either the dwarven town of Vergen or a Kaedweni camp depending on his alliances) and finally to
                            Loc Muinne where he has a final face off with a dragon.</p>

                        <p>Geralt of Rivia Played by: Henry Cavill Faction: School of the Wolf His story so far: Also known as the White Wolf and the Butcher of Blaviken, the famous witcher Geralt of Rivia has spent decades traveling the Continent slaying
                            monsters for coin. While many think of him as an unfeeling mercenary, he has a strict code when it comes to what work to accept. He’s also very devoted to his friends and loved ones, willing to do anything he can to protect
                            them. Powers: Like all witchers, Geralt underwent intense training to learn to identify, track and fight monsters. He successfully underwent the Trial of the Grasses, receiving mutations that gave him heightened senses, fast
                            healing and resistance to pain, poison and disease. Geralt also received additional mutations that resulted in his signature white hair and gave him even greater strength, speed and endurance than those of a typical Witcher.</p>
                        <p>Princess Cirilla Played by: Freya Allan Faction: Cintra Her story so far: The granddaughter of Queen Calanthe is the sole survivor of the royal family of Cintra. She narrowly escaped the Nilfgaardian invasion at the outset of Season
                            1 and has faced many hardships on the way to finding Geralt. The White Wolf saved Ciri’s father’s life and, in return, called upon the Law of Surprise, an ancient custom where someone who owes their life to another rewards
                            them with something they have but don’t know about yet. In this case, it turned out that Duny’s new bride, Pavetta, was already pregnant with Ciri. Destiny now bonds Geralt to Ciri. Powers: Ciri’s mother, Princess Pavetta,
                            had a tremendous amount of magical power, and Ciri seems to have inherited that ability. She’s used it to devastating effect to escape from would-be captors and will need to learn to control it.</p>
