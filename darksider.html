                        <p>In Darksiders, players control War, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, in a third-person perspective. The world is split into separate locations with many areas initially inaccessible until later in the game. The center
                            of the world, The Scalding Gallow, functions as a hub where War is given new objectives and paths to unlock new areas, many of which require the use of newly-gained abilities to progress.
                        </p>
                        <p>Although War is initially limited to the use of his two-handed signature sword, Chaos Eater, he eventually obtains other weapons throughout the course of the game. He also has a Scythe, which he uses as his other main offensive
                            weapon. Weapons have different combinations of attack that can be obtained throughout the game. Along with combos, players are encouraged to use countering moves, blocks, and swift dodging. Projectile weapons such as a revolver
                            and a boomerang-style throwing blade can also be used. Objects scattered throughout the environment can also be used as weapons and projectiles. At a later point in the game, War gains the ability to summon a horse that provides
                            faster movement and increased attack power.</p>
                        <p>Along with weapon-based attacks, War can also use an array of magic-based attacks, known as Wrath powers, that are both offensive & defensive in nature. The amount of Wrath powers available are determined through the Wrath meter.
                            War's Chaos Form, which transforms him into a large, fiery and extremely resistant entity can be activated once War's Chaos meter is filled.</p>

                        <p>Since the beginning of time, the kingdoms of Heaven and Hell have been at war, with neither side able to gain an advantage over the other. A mediator known as the Charred Council arose to maintain "the Balance" of order and stability.
                            The Council created a warrior brotherhood, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (War, Death, Strife, and Fury) to enforce their rules by punishing transgressors. Foreseeing that humans, though weak, would grow to be crucial
                            to the Balance, the Council declared them to be a third kingdom under their protection. Heaven and Hell agreed a truce and sealed it with the mystical Seven Seals, to be broken only when the kingdom of Man had become strong
                            enough to join in the Endwar. Breaking the seals would bring about the Apocalypse, with the breaking of the final Seventh Seal calling the Four Horsemen to Earth.</p>
                        <p>The Horseman of War (Liam O'Brien) arrives on present-day Earth, where the Endwar appears to have begun: armies of angels and demons are engaged in battle, with mankind caught in the middle. Confronting the archangel Abaddon (Troy
                            Baker), general of Heaven's army, War discovers that – although he believes he is responding to a call – the Seventh Seal has not been broken and the other three Horsemen are nowhere to be found. Surprised by War's presence,
                            Abaddon is killed by the gigantic demon Straga (Troy Baker). War battles Straga and gains the upper hand, but mysteriously loses his strength mid-battle. He is saved from death by the Charred Council (Fred Tatasciore), who
                            accuses War of siding with the forces of Hell and causing the Apocalypse prematurely. Protesting his innocence, War demands a chance to find the real culprits. The Council agrees, but War is stripped of his former powers and
                            bound to a Council servant, the Watcher (Mark Hamill), who is authorised to guide and control him, even to kill him if he strays from his mission. War returns to a ruined Earth, where a century has passed since "the Destroyer"
                            and his army annihilated humanity and defeated the forces of Heaven. The remnants of the angelic army, stranded on Earth, have formed a resistance force called the Hellguard, led by Abaddon's former lieutenant Uriel (Moon Bloodgood).</p>
                        <p>The demon merchant Vulgrim (Phil LaMarr) tells War that to find the Destroyer, he will need to travel to the hellish Black Tower. Vulgrim advises War to seek advice from Samael (Vernon Wells), a demon lord imprisoned for challenging
                            his master's dominance. After being released, Samael explains that four ancient monsters called the Chosen are the guardians of the Black Tower. He asks War to kill them and bring him their hearts so that he can regain his
                            power and War can enter the Tower. One by one War slays all four of the Chosen, although it is revealed by the last of them that their purpose was not to guard the Black Tower but to prevent Samael's return. Samael, revitalised
                            by their hearts, honours his bargain and opens a pathway to the Tower. He also hints that the Council, through their minion the Watcher, are keeping War weakened for their own purposes.</p>

                        <p>The player character is War, first of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Along with the rest of the Horsemen, War is not aligned to Heaven or Hell but instead serves at the whim of the Charred Council, whose purpose is upholding
                            the balance between the two forces. He maintains a strict code of honor and will battle any obstacle in his way. It is prophesied that War and the other Horsemen will descend upon the Earth once the Apocalypse begins.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the story, War is bound to and accompanied by The Watcher, an emissary charged by the Council to watch over and guide War on his journey. Because of his assigned role, he is constantly skeptical and cynical of War's
                            actions, much to War's annoyance and often anger. He relishes his duty and enjoys needling War and bossing him about simply because he can. War later employs the guidance of Samael, once a mighty and feared demon, now imprisoned,
                            who himself seeks vengeance against the Destroyer, the main antagonist of the story and leader of the victorious forces on Earth. Many other characters become central to the overall plot, recurring at times. Among these is
                            Uriel, leader of Heaven's armies after their first leader, Abaddon, was killed during a major battle; now stranded on Earth, Uriel seeks revenge against those she believes responsible. Another recurring character is Vulgrim,
                            a demon merchant who provides gear and abilities for War in exchange for human souls. Finally there is Ulthane, also known as the Black Hammer, an "Old One" who at first is hostile towards War, but the two quickly become allies;
                            first after Ulthane aids War in entering the Griever's lair, then providing War with a magical revolver and re-forging the Armageddon Blade for him.</p>
