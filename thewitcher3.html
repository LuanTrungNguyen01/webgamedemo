                        <p>The Withcher in the game is a common motif in European myths. The place in the game is a large continent (Continnent or Mainland) with all kinds of races: humans, elves, or dwarves and a variety of monsters and demons that only
                            appear in legends. The main character is Geralt of Rivia, a witcher (monster hunter) from the Witcher School of Wolf with the nickname White Wolf, who travels through the lands in the northern realm of the Continent .
                        </p>
                        <p>The identities of Geralt and the main characters in the game are intricately intertwined, directly related to the events in Andrzej Sapkowski's novels and the two previous game versions, players can explore these things. through
                            dialogue with supporting characters (NPCs) and books throughout the series. For example, Yennefer was taken away by Wild Hunt, Geralt went to save her, then Ciri came to save both of them and then both Geralt and Yen lost their
                            memories (opening to The Witcher game). Ciri's adventures then, why she left Geralt and Yennefer, where she went and what she did before returning to the real world in Continent. It all makes up for a complicated life before
                            and after Geralt's amnesia, then regains some of his memory (eg Yen was his lover before he lost his memory, after he lost his memory. he falls in love with Triss again, then recovers and remembers Yen). It all explains why
                            both Ciri and Yennefer who didn't appear in the previous two games suddenly became the main characters in this third part.</p>
                        <p>Continuing the story from The Witcher 2, the mighty Nilfgaardian Empire of the South under the rule of Emperor Emhyr var Emeris led troops to conquer an alliance of northern kingdoms. Emhyr captured the Kingdom of Temeria and extended
                            the war into King Radovid V's Kingdom of Redania and Skellige, an island nation off the coast of the Continent. Meanwhile, Redania under the rule of Radovid (a tyrant but strategically minded) still defended resiliently against
                            Nilfgaard's attack, on the one hand continued to launch campaigns against witches and witches. domestic shaman in a brutal way.</p>

                        <p>After a few years apart, the witcher Geralt of Rivia, now recovering his memory, unexpectedly receives a letter from his former lover, the witch Yennefer of Vengerberg. He immediately sets out to find her, and when the two reunite,
                            Yennefer leads Geralt back to Vizima, the capital of the Kingdom of Temeria being occupied by Emperor Emhyr var Emreis of the Nilfgaardian Empire. There he meets Emhyr and is informed by him that there has been news of Ciri's
                            appearance (Ciri or Cirilla is the adopted daughter of Grealt and Yennefer and Emhyr's long-lost daughter) and is currently in a bad state. It is very dangerous to be chased by the forces of Wild Hunt (Wild Hunt is an army
                            of Elves under the command of Eredin from another world, with the ambition to capture the power inherited from Elder Blood in Ciri). According to Emhyr's intelligence, Ciri may have appeared in Velen (a province of Temeria
                            devastated by war) and Novigrad (The Free City and also the largest city in the North). At the same time, Yen also discovers traces that Ciri may be in Skellige. Geralt immediately set off for Velen while Yen also set out for
                            Skellige to find clues about Ciri.</p>
                        <p>Upon reaching Velen, Geralt sought out Emhyr's spy, but Wild Hunt was one step ahead of him, killing the spy. Fortunately, Geralt was able to find the important documents left by this person. Thereby he learns that Ciri was once
                            in the territory of a local Baron who called himself the Bloody Baron and was associated with the Ladies of the Wood. In fact, three extremely dangerous ancient entities called The Crones wanted to eat Ciri.) With help from
                            his old friend the witch Keira Metz as well as information gained from the Bloody Baron, Geralt learns that Ciri was once accompanied by a mysterious elf mage. It was also determined that Ciri had left Velen for Novigrad. Arriving
                            in Novigrad, he figured Ciri would definitely try to contact him or Yen, or her old friends. He sought out the witch Triss Merigold (his lover after he lost his memory), but she received no contact from Ciri. Triss pointed
                            him to a medium, through which, Geralt learned that Ciri had found Dandelion and Dudu (two old friends) and was involved with a big guy in the city's underworld nicknamed as Whoreson Junior (Bastard Son). With the help of Sigismund
                            Djikstra and Vernon Roche, Geralt was able to track down Whoreson Junior's lair and gain more information about Ciri. Simultaneously with the help of Triss, Priscilla, Zoltan Chivay and Dudu he was able to rescue Dandelion
                            who was currently being held captive. Through Dandelion's account, introduced by him, Ciri reached out to Whoreson Junior in the hope that his extensive connections could help her break a certain curse. However, things got
                            out of hand when Whoreson Junior turned against Ciri. She and Dandelion were pursued by soldiers, and after covering Dandelion to escape safely, Ciri used teleportation magic. However, worried for Ciri's safety, Dandelion returned
                            and was captured.</p>
                        <p>The sudden disappearance of Ciri in Novigrad caused the clues here to come to a dead end, Geralt decided to go to Skellige to reunite with Yennefer. He and Yen tracked down before that Ciri and the mysterious elf mage were chased
                            by Wild Hunt to Skellige, but the mage was able to open the gate to help Ciri escape to Velen. Later, Geralt and Yen go to a village that was attacked by Wild Hunt and find the whereabouts of a family that once helped Ciri
                            here. Thereby they learn that after leaving Novigrad, Ciri has returned to Skellige for the second time to reunite with the elf mage and they continue to be pursued here by the Wild Hunt. Ciri may have escaped, or been under
                            a powerful curse from the Wild Hunt and transformed into an ugly creature. Geralt suddenly remembered that he had met this creature in the Bloody Baron's house, its name was Uma. Geralt makes an appointment with Yen at Kaer
                            Morhen (the fortress where Geralt was trained as a child) and returns to Velen and takes Uma away.</p>
