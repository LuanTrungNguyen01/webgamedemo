                        <p>Players take control of Death, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The core gameplay is an action role-playing hack and slash style. The game makes frequent use of interactive puzzle elements, requiring the player to think
                            their way through a series of levers, doors, elevators, portals, etc. in order to traverse areas and reach objectives.</p>
                        <p>Maps are vast and each contain open world regions that can be explored freely on foot or by horse, along with numerous dungeons where quest objectives are generally carried out. There are main and side quests, with main and side
                            boss fights. Worlds can be traversed via fast travel, whereby the player can teleport to certain map points instantly. While inside a dungeon, the player is allowed to fast travel back to the overworld while saving their dungeon
                            location for continuation later without losing progress.</p>
                        <p>Death is aided by Despair, a horse that is available for use in open areas of the overworld for faster travel, and Dust, a raven that guides him to his objectives. Death's primary weapons are two scythes, one wielded in each hand.
                            Secondary weapons include melee weapons like hammers, axes, and maces as "slow" options; "fast" options are generally gauntlet-style weapons that provide the player with claws and other bladed arm extensions, at the expense
                            of less range and power than the slow weapons.</p>

                        <p>Darksiders II is parallel to the previous game. The Four Horsemen - War, Strife, Fury, and Death, the player character - are the last of the Nephilim, cursed fusions of angels and demons who waged war on all of Creation to have
                            a place to live. To preserve the balance of the Universe, the Four, tired of conquest, received incredible powers from the Charred Council in exchange for slaughtering their kin. Death personally cut down the last of their
                            brethren, Absalom, the first Nephilim; this earned him the title of Kinslayer, among others. However, he secretly preserved the souls of the Nephilim in an amulet, defying the Council, and gave the amulet to the Keeper of Secrets,
                            also known as the Crowfather, for safekeeping.</p>
                        <p>While War is charged with his crimes, Death, sure of his brother's innocence, sets out on a personal mission to erase his brother's 'crime' and resurrect humanity. He first travels to the Icy Veil, a dimension between the three
                            kingdoms of Heaven, Hell, and Earth, to seek the Crowfather for proof of War's innocence and the way to restore Earth. The Crowfather tells Death that he must go to the Tree of Life in order to restore humanity, and demands
                            that Death take back the amulet. When Death refuses, the Crowfather attacks him in the shape of War. Death is thus forced to kill the Crowfather, but the amulet shatters and the fragments embed themselves in his chest, knocking
                            him out and sending him into a portal created by the Crowfather's death.</p>
                        <p>Death wakes up in the Forge Lands, a world populated by the Makers, physically imposing beings who are the Architects of Creation. He learns that their world, and many others, has been overrun with Corruption, a dark force that
                            has blocked off the Tree of Life and has taken over many of the Maker's constructs. The Makers had crafted a massive Guardian to combat the Corruption, but had to abandon it before finishing the task due to the surrounding
                            threats. With the help of constructs and a Maker named Karn, Death eventually reaches the Guardian. However, upon activation, the Guardian is tainted by Corruption and goes on a rampage. Death battles the Guardian and destroys
                            it, allowing it to be reassembled free of Corruption. The Guardian self-destructs in the grasp of the creature blocking the path to the Tree of Life, which allows Death to reach his goal. Upon reaching the entrance, however,
                            Death is seized by Corruption and dragged into the Tree. There, Death is accosted by the shadowy form of Absalom, whose hatred lasted beyond his slaying at Death's hands and birthed the Corruption, enabling him to take his
                            revenge on Creation.</p>

                        <p>The player character is War, first of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Along with the rest of the Horsemen, War is not aligned to Heaven or Hell but instead serves at the whim of the Charred Council, whose purpose is upholding
                            the balance between the two forces. He maintains a strict code of honor and will battle any obstacle in his way. It is prophesied that War and the other Horsemen will descend upon the Earth once the Apocalypse begins.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the story, War is bound to and accompanied by The Watcher, an emissary charged by the Council to watch over and guide War on his journey. Because of his assigned role, he is constantly skeptical and cynical of War's
                            actions, much to War's annoyance and often anger. He relishes his duty and enjoys needling War and bossing him about simply because he can. War later employs the guidance of Samael, once a mighty and feared demon, now imprisoned,
                            who himself seeks vengeance against the Destroyer, the main antagonist of the story and leader of the victorious forces on Earth. Many other characters become central to the overall plot, recurring at times. Among these is
                            Uriel, leader of Heaven's armies after their first leader, Abaddon, was killed during a major battle; now stranded on Earth, Uriel seeks revenge against those she believes responsible. Another recurring character is Vulgrim,
                            a demon merchant who provides gear and abilities for War in exchange for human souls. Finally there is Ulthane, also known as the Black Hammer, an "Old One" who at first is hostile towards War, but the two quickly become allies;
                            first after Ulthane aids War in entering the Griever's lair, then providing War with a magical revolver and re-forging the Armageddon Blade for him.</p>
